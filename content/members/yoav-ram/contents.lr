I'm a **theoretical population biologist**.
I study evolutionary biology, ecology, and cultural evolution (aka _population biology_) using mathematical models, numerical and stochastic simulations, computational and Bayesian statistics, and machine and deep learning models.

I'm a **senior lecturer** (asst. prof.) at the [School of Zoology](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/lp-en-zoology), Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University.
I'm affiliated with the [Sagol School of Neuroscience](https://en-sagol.tau.ac.il/), the [Safra Center for Bioinformatics](https://safrabio.cs.tau.ac.il/), and the [Center for Combatting Pandemics](http://pandemics.tau.ac.il) at Tel Aviv University.

I was previously a **senior lecturer** at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.idc.ac.il/he/schools/cs/pages/home.aspx) at Reichman University (IDC Herzliya) and a CEHG **postdoctoral fellow** in the [Feldman lab](http://www-evo.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.
I completed a direct **PhD** in the [Hadany lab](http://www.hadanylab.com) and a **BSc** in math and biology, both at Tel Aviv University.

I live with my partner, four kids, and too many cats.
I enjoy [cooking](https://www.ptitim.com/fermentation_part1/), listening to [music](https://youtu.be/jhzm6S7jaQo), [reading](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/12/how-real-world-science-sets-expanse-apart-other-sci-fi-shows), running, and dancing.
