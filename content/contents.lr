title: Ram Lab
---
body:

We study **evolutionary biology, ecology, and cultural evolution**, using **mathematical, computational, statistical, and machine-learning models** and **collaborations** with empirical biologists. Our interests span a wide range of biological systems, from viruses, bacteria, and fungi to whales and humans.
See the [research page](/research) to learn about our research interests and projects.

**Our lab is in the [School of Zoology](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/zoology/) in the [Faculty of Life Sciences](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/) at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il)**.<br>
We are also affiliated with the [Sagol School of Neuroscience](https://en-sagol.tau.ac.il), the [Safra Center for Bioinformatics](https://safrabio.cs.tau.ac.il), the [Center for AI & Data Science](https://datascience.tau.ac.il/yoav-ram), and the [Center for Combating Pandemics](https://en-pandemics.tau.ac.il) at Tel Aviv University.
We are also part of the [Minerva Center on Lab Evolution](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/center/LabEvolution/) and the [Minerva Center for the study of Population Fragmentation](https://www.mcpopfrag.com).
