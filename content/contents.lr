title: Ram Lab
---
body:

We study **evolutionary biology, ecology, and cultural evolution**, using **mathematical, computational, statistical, and machine-learning models** and **collaborations** with empirical biologists. We are interested in a variety of biological systems: from viruses, bacteria, and fungi, to whales, hyrax, and humans.
See the [research page](/research) to read more about our research interests and projects.

**Our lab is in the [School of Zoology](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/zoology/) in the [Faculty of Life Sciences](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/) at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il)**.<br>
We are also affiliated with the [Sagol School of Neuroscience](https://en-sagol.tau.ac.il) and the [Safra Center for Bioinformatics](https://safrabio.cs.tau.ac.il) at Tel Aviv University.

If you are interested in joining us, please email [Yoav](mailto:yoav@yoavram.com).
