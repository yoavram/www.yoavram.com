body:

We study **evolutionary biology**, **ecology**, **cultural evolution**, **behavior**, and **communication**, using mathematical, computational, statistical, and AI models and collaborations with empirical biologists. 
Our interests span various biological systems, from viruses and microbes to cetaceans and hominids.
See the [research page](/research) to learn about our research interests and projects.

**Our lab is in the [School of Zoology](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/zoology/) in the [Faculty of Life Sciences](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/) at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il)**.<br>
The lab is a member of the [Safra Center for Bioinformatics](https://safrabio.cs.tau.ac.il), the [Center for AI & Data Science](https://datascience.tau.ac.il/yoav-ram), and the [Sagol School of Neuroscience](https://en-sagol.tau.ac.il) at Tel Aviv University. <br>
